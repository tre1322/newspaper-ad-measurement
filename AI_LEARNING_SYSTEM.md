# AI Learning System for Automatic Ad Detection

## Overview

Your newspaper ad measurement system now includes a complete AI learning system that learns from your manual ad identifications to automatically detect ads in future publications. The system gets smarter each week as you continue to verify and correct ad identifications.

## How It Works

### 1. Training Data Collection
- **Automatic Feature Extraction**: Every time you manually identify or verify an ad, the system extracts 25+ visual features from that ad region
- **Feature Types**: 
  - Geometric (size, position, aspect ratio)
  - Content analysis (brightness, contrast, texture)
  - Border detection (edge strength, rectangularity)
  - White space analysis (ad vs text density)

### 2. Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier (robust and interpretable)
- **Training**: Weekly retraining on accumulated verified ads
- **Accuracy**: Expected 80-90% accuracy after 4-6 weeks of data collection

### 3. Automatic Detection
- **Integration**: ML predictions automatically replace CV detection when model is available
- **Confidence Filtering**: Only high-confidence predictions (70%+) are automatically applied
- **Fallback**: System falls back to traditional edge detection if ML model unavailable

## Current Status

✅ **591 verified ads** already in your database - excellent training data!
✅ **2 publication types** with training data available
✅ **Ready to train** your first ML models immediately

## Getting Started

### 1. Access the AI Learning Dashboard
- Navigate to **AI Learning** in the top menu
- Or go directly to `http://localhost:5000/ml`

### 2. Train Your First Models
```
For each publication type (broadsheet, special_edition, etc.):
1. Click "Train Model" on the dashboard
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for training to complete
3. Check the accuracy metrics
```

### 3. Start Using Automatic Detection
Once models are trained:
- Upload new publications normally
- The system will automatically use ML predictions instead of basic edge detection
- Ads will be pre-identified when pages load
- You can still manually correct any mistakes (which improves the model)

## Features Added

### New Database Tables
- **MLModel**: Stores trained models with version control
- **TrainingData**: Stores extracted features from verified ads

### New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/ml/train/<publication_type>` - Train model for specific publication type  
- `GET /api/ml/stats` - Get training statistics
- `POST /api/ml/collect_training_data` - Manually collect training data
- `GET /api/ml/predict/<page_id>` - Get ML predictions for a page

### AI Learning Dashboard (`/ml`)
- Training data statistics by publication type
- Model performance metrics
- One-click model training
- Training progress tracking

### Enhanced Ad Detection
- **Smart Integration**: Uses ML when available, falls back to CV detection
- **Confidence-Based**: Only shows high-confidence predictions
- **Type Classification**: Predicts ad type (display, entertainment, classified, etc.)

## Expected Learning Timeline

### Week 1-2: Data Collection
- Continue manual ad identification as normal
- System builds training dataset automatically
- Monitor progress in AI Learning dashboard

### Week 3-4: First Models
- Train initial models (you already have enough data!)
- 70-80% accuracy expected initially
- System starts pre-marking obvious ads

### Week 5-8: Optimization
- Models improve with more corrections
- 80-90% accuracy achievable
- Significant time savings on ad identification

### Ongoing: Continuous Learning
- Weekly model retraining recommended
- System adapts to seasonal changes
- Performance continues improving

## Technical Implementation

### Feature Extraction (AdLearningEngine.extract_features)
Extracts 25+ features from each ad region:
- **Position**: x, y, center coordinates (normalized)
- **Geometry**: width, height, area, aspect ratio, perimeter
- **Content**: mean/std intensity, intensity range
- **Texture**: Local binary pattern analysis, gradient features
- **Edges**: Edge density using Canny detection
- **Borders**: Border contrast and uniformity analysis
- **White Space**: Ratio of white vs black pixels
- **Shape**: Rectangularity score, connected components

### Model Training (AdLearningEngine.train_model)
- **Data Split**: 80% training, 20% validation
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization
- **Algorithm**: RandomForestClassifier with balanced class weights
- **Evaluation**: Training and validation accuracy tracking
- **Versioning**: Timestamped model versions with rollback capability

### Prediction Integration
- **Seamless**: Automatically replaces existing AdBoxDetector when trained model available
- **Hybrid Approach**: Uses CV detection to find candidate regions, ML to classify them
- **Quality Control**: Confidence thresholds prevent false positives

## Files Modified/Added

### Core System
- `app.py` - Added AdLearningEngine class and ML integration
- `requirements.txt` - Added scikit-learn, joblib, scipy
- `add_ml_tables.py` - Database migration script

### Templates  
- `templates/ml_dashboard.html` - AI Learning dashboard interface
- `templates/base.html` - Added AI Learning navigation link

### Database Schema
- `MLModel` table - Stores trained models and metadata
- `TrainingData` table - Stores extracted features and labels

## Usage Instructions

### For Weekly Training (Recommended)
1. Go to AI Learning dashboard
2. Click "Collect New Training Data" (processes any new verified ads)
3. Click "Train Model" for each publication type
4. Monitor accuracy improvements over time

### For Manual Control
- Use API endpoints for programmatic access
- Set confidence thresholds per your needs
- Activate/deactivate specific model versions
